> _A Functional Programming-inspired pattern to separate instructions and interpretations._
> 関数型プログラミングにインスピレーションを得た模様は、命令と解釈を分離します。

> We can learn a lot of useful code patterns from Functional Programming. One of them is splitting up some of our code into separate 'instructions' and 'interpreters'. By keeping them distinct, we can more easily re-use our code, and make it easier to test. This talk will show you how to use this technique: we'll start with simple examples, dig into a real-world library like 'redux-saga', and finally drive the wheels of a toy robot.

This talk was given at [NodeFest 2017](http://nodefest.jp/2017/speakers.html#rob) in Tokyo, Japan.
