This was a mishmash of [last year's "Property-Based Testing" talk at Railscamp](/talks/2015/06/property-based-testing) and parts from a hopeful submission to [this year's CampJS](http://vii.campjs.com/), given at the Sydney [Ruby-or-Rails Oceania](http://www.meetup.com/Ruby-On-Rails-Oceania-Sydney/) meetup.
