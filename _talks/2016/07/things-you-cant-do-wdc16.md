  Flexible. Dynamic. Feature-rich. These are usually terms to describe programming languages, libraries and frameworks; they *sound* great, but what are we trading off to get them? And what can we can gain if we run in the other direction and strive for *less* of these qualities?

> In this talk we'll draw a line straight through ES6, immutability, "functional-style", Flow and TypeScript in twenty minutes: why they're useful, what you have to give up to make the best use of them, and why that isn't a bad thing. It's a tall order, but it's a tour that'll get you thinking, and will leave you with enough jumping-off points to dig into for months to come.

This is a talk that I primarily gave at [Web Directions Code 2016](http://www.webdirections.org/code16/speakers/rob-howard.html), and afterwards at [MelbJS](http://melbjs.com), and beforehand (in draft form) at [SydJS](http://sydjs.com). I'm considering this the last version of this talk, and probably won't give it again.

Big thanks to [John Allsopp](https://twitter.com/johnallsopp) and the [Web Directions](http://webdirections.org) team for giving me the opportunity to speak at Code, to [Mark Dalgleish](https://twitter.com/markdalgleish) for inviting me to MelbJS, to [@strawz](https://twitter.com/strawz) for recording my SydJS draft run, and to everyone who attended. ðŸ˜Š
