excerpt: |
  In 1977, NASA launched the Voyager probes into space. Each carried a copper â€˜vinylâ€™ record, with music, speechâ€¦ and 115 images, all inscribed on the disc as audio! In this talk weâ€™ll pretend to be aliens; weâ€™ll use Ruby to read the audio, recreate the images, and learn some space history too. ðŸš€âœ¨
