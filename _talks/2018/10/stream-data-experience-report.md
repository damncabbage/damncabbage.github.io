</a>

This talk is a little "Intro to Property Testing", a little "[Data] Generator Pitfalls", and a little "Pains and Positives using StreamData in an Elixir app I worked on for five months".

(The slides themselves may be a little incomprehensible by themselves without speaker notes, but I hope there's enough derivable substance in there. ðŸ˜…)
