  This workshop is comprised of a short talk that introduces the main parts of a compiler, followed by an at-your-own-pace tour through building a little one of your own. We'll start with a simple language that compiles to JavaScript.

This is the [set of slides](/talks/2018/11/nodefest-compiler-workshop.pdf) and [workshop materials](https://github.com/damncabbage/js-compiler-workshop) for the [compiler workshop I gave at NodeFest 2018](https://nodefest.jp/2018/speakers.html#speaker-damncabbage).

> "Compilers" are usually-mysterious things that a lot of us actually use and rely on from day to day, eg. the JavaScript V8 compiler, the TypeScript compiler, or the Clang+LLVM compilers. Digging into how these work can be satisfying (like sleuthing a good puzzle); but some of the ways we implement them can appear in other forms, such as when validating user input, transforming big structures, or when separating side-effects from business logic.
