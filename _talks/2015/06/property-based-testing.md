*A different way of testing, putting your tests to work for you.*

Audio recorded at Railscamp itself. Still some minor goofs in the slides (a missing `|` on `|x`, and a missing `.abs` on `float.abs`) that've been corrected in the PDF linked above, and one verbal goof where I claimed that Erlang had QuickCheck first. Oops.
