Here’s the scenario:

1. You’re sitting at your desktop, and you start a Screen session.
2. You do a bunch of work (say, lots of vim and a `git commit`); and then rush off.
3. You log in remotely, reconnect your Screen session with `screen -dR`, and try to do something that uses an SSH key (say, you `git push` to github).
4. Your SSH session mysteriously hangs.
5. A Ctrl-C later and a head-scratch later, you run `ssh -v git@github.com`, and you get as far as `debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa ...`

Meanwhile, back on your desktop at home, GNOME has popped up this dialog:

<img src="/images/posts/gnome-password-lock.png" alt="GNOME says, 'Enter password to unlock private key'" />

Bollocks.


### The Fix

To stop this happening again, run the following:

```
$ sudo gconftool-2 --set -t bool /apps/gnome-keyring/daemon-components/ssh false
```
