It's 2015 and I haven't touched the blog theme in about [two years](https://web.archive.org/web/20130123060803/http://robhoward.id.au/). Given it's lack of mobile anything (`position:fixed` menus!) and terrible typography, it's time for a clean break.

So until I can make that clean break, you get the Jekyll 2.0 default theme. Sorry. Back to the regular whinging until then.
