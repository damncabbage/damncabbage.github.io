In a similar vein:

* **Java is French.** A relative new-comer, loaded down with seemingly excess baggage (cf: all those goddamn silent letters), but is still efficient and gets the point across in a nuanced fashion.

* **Perl is heavily-accented regional English.** Like, say, Nottingham English. It's incomprehensible as hell, but pretty good once you realise what *"Unfort he's notawith's nymore, but-he's still 'ere ina 'arts"* means.

* **Ruby is plain-form Japanese.** Sparse, flexible, but low on context. Better have figured out the subject of the sentence when someone says the equivalent of "tomorrow 4pm at library".

* **Smalltalk is Japanese Keigo.** Same deal, but older and more decorated.

* *Brainfuck is Morse Code*... Made by blowing raspberries.

* **XSLT is Pig Latin.** I'm sure it was very funny the first couple of times it was used.

* **PHP is Singaporean English.** A blended language, mixing of a bunch of different styles in one package. Familiar-sounding but tough to fully understand, seemingly backwards anyone who recognises where the words originally came from, and needs years of practice before you don't sound like a complete tool when using it. (*"This ger arh, she siao 4D."*)

* **Dart is Esperanto.** I'm sure it'll totally catch on.

* **Clojure is Danish.** Nobody [actually speaks Danish](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-mOy8VUEBk).

Finally, years of language study put to practical use.

(Props to [Geoff](http://blackicemedia.com) for *Dart* and *Brainfuck*.)
