Type Wrappers are a way of taking an existing type (like strings, numbers, etc) and wrapping them in _another_ type, both so they can't be confused with other things of the same type, and to represent things like validation in a way that Flow can check. They are variously known as Nominal Type Aliases, [Opaque Type Aliases](https://docs.hhvm.com/hack/type-aliases/opaque), or [Newtypes](https://wiki.haskell.org/Newtype)<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup>. Let's get to it. ðŸ˜Š


## Creating and Using a Type Wrapper

I have a library called [flow-classy-type-wrapper](https://npmjs.com/package/flow-classy-type-wrapper); towards the end of this post, we'll get into the guts of how this works, but let's arm-wave for the moment. Here's an example of it in use:

```ts
import { TypeWrapper } from 'flow-classy-type-wrapper';

class Email extends TypeWrapper<string> {}

function validateEmail(x: string): (Email | null) {
  if (x.match(/@/)) {
    return Email.wrap(x);
  }
  return null;
}

function sendEmail(to: Email) {
  const toAsString = Email.unwrap(to);
  // A stand-in for sending an email:
  console.log("Sending to " + toAsString + "...");
}

const input = "hello@world.com";
const email = validateEmail(input);

if (email === null) {
  throw new Error("Was not email: " + input);
}
sendEmail(email);
```

Let's break this down into smaller pieces:

```ts
class Email extends TypeWrapper<string> {}
```

This extends the imported [`TypeWrapper` class](https://github.com/damncabbage/flow-classy-type-wrapper/blob/master/src/TypeWrapper.js), putting `string` in as its type parameter. If this looks unfamiliar to you, I recommend you [learn about these parameters](/blog/2017/01/effective-types-a-parameterised-type-primer-flow/) before continuing.

In any case: we have a class representing a new type, `Email`, that wraps another, `string`. It has two [static methods](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2015/02/02/static-members-in-es6.aspx) attached to it, `wrap` and `unwrap`. We'll use them in a moment.

```ts
function validateEmail(x: string): (Email | null) {
  if (x.match(/@/)) {
    return Email.wrap(x);
  }
  return null;
}
```

This is a function that accepts a `string`, and spits out either an `Email`, or `null`, depending whether it passes our rather flimsy valid-email check.

To get an `Email` value, we use the aforementioned `wrap` method; its type signature, for our example, looks like `function wrap(x: string): Email`. We use this `wrap` method to "wrap up" our string value so that it can't be directly used as a string anymore; the only thing that can make use of this wrapped-up value are things that expect `Email` specifically, which we'll see an example of below:

```ts
function sendEmail(to: Email) {
  const toAsString = Email.unwrap(to);
  console.log("Sending to " + toAsString + "..."); // <-- A stand-in for sending an email.
}
```

This function accepts an `Email`, and then unwraps it to get at the string which, in our toy example, just gets printed out. Much like `wrap` above, this `unwrap` function has a type signature that looks like `function unwrap(x: Email): string`.

Lastly:

```ts
const input = "hello@world.com";
const email = validateEmail(input);

if (email === null) {
  throw new Error("Was not email: " + input);
}
sendEmail(email);
```

We're pretending to accept user input here (a string). With that input, we put it through our validation function, and are made to (by Flow) handle the possibility of the result being `null`. After we've checked that, we know we have an `Email` value. We pass it on to `sendEmail` to use.

So what is this type wrapping useful for?


## Why

### In-line Documentation

The simplest benefit: it's a way of giving names to values of a particular variety, and goes a little way towards providing some documentation that's also checked by Flow.

On a visual level I'd personally say that a function with a signature `sendEmail(from: Email, to: Email, subject: string)` is easier to read than `sendEmail(to: string, from: string, subject: string)`. We also get the benefits of being able to look up what describes or produces an `Email` specifically, instead of any old string.


### Preventing Mixups

Say we have a function that takes two strings, and returns a potential user:

```ts
function createUser(email: string, password: string): Promise<User> {
  // ...
}

// Just validates and returns a string or null:
function validateEmail(email: string): (string | null) {
  // ...
}

// Much later:

// Let's pretend we got this email+password from user input.
const email = validateEmail("bob@example.com");
const password = "canhefixit";
if (email !== null) {
  const bob = createUser(email, password);
}
```

There's the _possibility_ of getting those strings mixed up, eg. `createUser(password, email)`. It's _unlikely_ in such a simple case, but with more complex ones like `fs.writeFile(string, string, string)` or `fs.writeSync(handle, buffer, number, number, number)` (both from the [Node.js standard library](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_writesync_fd_buffer_offset_length_position)), you can see how things can get mixed up if you have a bunch of arguments of the same type.

And yep, you could have them as part of an object with `email` and `password` fields instead, eg. `{ email: string, password: string }`. That helps not mix things up, but the wrapped version of the value is still safe even when _separated_ from that object:

```ts
const args: { email: string, password: string } =
  { email: "bob@example.com", password: "abc" };

const email = args.email;
// ... The type is now just string; we've lost the context.
```

```ts
const args: { email: Email, password: string } =
  { email: Email.wrap("bob@example.com"), password: "abc" };

const email = args.email;
// ... The type is still Email.
```


### Changing Code

We might need to change `createUser` to take a username instead, eg. shifting email off to something a user can add later after signup:

```ts
function createUser(username: string, password: string): Promise<User> {
  // ...
}

function validateEmail(email: string): (string | null) {
  // ...
}

// Much later:
const email = validateEmail("bob@example.com");
const password = "canhefixit";
if (email !== null) {
  const bob = createUser(email, password);
}
```

Uh oh. `bob@example.com` isn't a valid username; suddenly this user creation step fails. Hopefully, if we have tests for this path through the code, we might have caught this. But what if we use a typed wrapper to make it so that Flow tells us *immediately* if we change something like this?

```ts
// ---- Before change: takes an Email ----
function createUser(email: Email, password: string): Promise<User> {
  // ...
}

function validateEmail(email: string): (Email | null) {
  // ...
}

// Much later:
const email = validateEmail("bob@example.com"); // type: Email | null
const password = "canhefixit";
if (email !== null) {
  const bob = createUser(email, password);
}
```

```
// ----- After change: takes a Username -----
function createUser(username: Username, password: string): Promise<User> {
  // ...
}

// Much later:
const email = validateEmail("bob@example.com"); // type: Email | null
const password = "canhefixit";
if (email !== null) {
  const bob = createUser(email, password);
  // ðŸ’¥ Boom! ðŸ’¥
  // createUser(email, password);
  //            ^^^^^ Email. This type is incompatible with
  //                  the expected param type of
  // function createUser(username: Username, password: string): Promise<User> {
  //                               ^^^^^^^^ Username
}
```



### "Gatekeeper" Functions

Lets look at `validateEmail` from above

```ts
function validateEmail(x: string): (Email | null) {
  // ...
}
```

We have a function that produces `Email`. What if, to make an `Email`, we had to put the input through the `validateEmail` function?

```
// ----- email.js -----
import { TypeWrapper } from 'flow-classy-type-wrapper';

// Set up our Email type-wrapper around string, but don't export it, instead...
class Email extends TypeWrapper<string> {}

// ... Export only the type, for use in type signatures.
export type EmailType = Email;

// Export the unwrap function.
export const unwrap = Email.unwrap;

// Export the validateEmail function.
export function validateEmail(x: string): (Email | null) {
  // ...
}
```

```ts
// ----- stuff.js -----
// We can only import the type, email validation, and email unwrapping; we
// can't create our own Email anymore.
import type { EmailType as Email } from './email';
import { validateEmail, unwrap }

const email = validateEmail("bob@example.com");
if (email === null) throw new Error("Invalid email");

// We know we have an Email now; we could give it to createUser() here, or pass
// it to somewhere else deep in our program, knowing that it's a Email.
createUser(email, "canhefixit");
```

We only export `validateEmail`, `unwrap` and the `Email` type itself. In doing so, make sure that *any* `Email` values being tossed around our app have been passed through the `validateEmail` function; there's no other way to make one without using an `any` backdoor, and we can use [eslint to warn whenever we try to use these](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-flowtype#eslint-plugin-flowtype-rules-no-weak-types).


## A Sliding Scale of Safety

As we've just done, you can ratchet up the safety, at the expense of restricting how you construct and use these values. I personally use wrapped types as much as practical, them having saved my butt more than a few times (eg. where a "string" has been passed through a few tiers of functions, to be accidentally mixed up somewhere else). But feel free to use this with some values you want to carefully control, like User IDs, escaped strings, etc.


## So what _are_ the `Email` Values?

(And what is the performance overhead for this?)

In the case of `Email`: just strings! "Wrapping" the types never transforms them. The idea of `Email` being a separate thing is entirely for Flow's benefit, and evaporates when the program is run.

Let's look at `TypeWrapper`'s definition:

```ts
export class TypeWrapper<Inner> {
  // A constructor that can't be called (nothing can satisfy the "empty" type).
  constructor(_: empty): void {}

  // Inner Value -> Wrapped Value
  static wrap(x: Inner): this {
    return (x: any); // eslint-disable-line flowtype/no-weak-types
  }

  // Wrapped Value -> Inner Value
  static unwrap(x: this): Inner {
    return (x: any); // eslint-disable-line flowtype/no-weak-types
  }
}
```

It's a class that, when extended, provides a class with some `static` helper methods. It could be a type and a couple of functions, but this way lets you define a wrapper with an `class Foo extends TypeWrapper<Bar>` one-liner.

If you fill in the type-variable gaps, you could think of it like the following (assuming our earlier `Email`-wrapping`-string example):

```ts
export class Email {
  constructor(_: empty): void {}

  // string -> Email
  static wrap(x: string): Email {
    return (x: any);
  }

  // Email -> string
  static unwrap(x: Email): string {
    return (x: any);
  }
}
```

All we're doing with the `Email.wrap` and `Email.unwrap` methods are just *casting* between two values. The underlying value never changes.

There _is_ overhead, but it's minimal:

* If you're transpiling to ES5 or below, every `class` definition will be converted to its ES5 equivalent. A one-time cost for `class`, plus about seven unminified lines of Babel output per `extends TypeWrapper`.
* Every time you wrap or unwrap a value, it goes through a function that looks like:  
  ```ts
  function(x) { return x; }
  ```  
  ... Which sounds wasteful, but [in this performance test](https://jsperf.com/damncabbage-x-vs-id-x), the difference [doesn't even seem to clear the margin of error](https://i.imgur.com/2LYwdFG.png).


## Further Examples

I'll leave you now with some examples of Type Wrappers in action. I'm [interested to hear](https://twitter.com/damncabbage) what other uses you come up with. ðŸ˜Š

```ts
// Something representing a positive number; a small set of
// the all the possible number values, without having to
// list them all out.
// (This example is pretty similar to Email above.)
class PositiveNumber extends TypeWrapper<number> {}

function toPositive(n: number): (number | null) {
  if (n >= 0) {
    return PositiveNumber.wrap(n);
  }
  return null;
}
```

```ts
// Let's get trickier. :)
// This is a type representing an Array of T, guaranteed
// to have at least one element:
class NonEmptyArray<T> extends TypeWrapper<Array<T>> {}

// eg. number, Array<number> -> NonEmptyArray<number>
function toNonEmptyArray<T>(
  first: T,
  rest: Array<T>
): NonEmptyArray<T> {
  const list = [first].concat(rest);
  return NonEmptyArray.wrap(list);
}

const nemp = toNonEmptyArray(1, [2,3,4]);
const list = NonEmptyArray.unwrap(nemp);
console.log(list); // [1,2,3,4]
```

```ts
// This uses something called "Phantom Types", the subject of my next post.
// We have Temperature wrapping a number, but then has
// Temperature carry some extra information (eg. Celsius)
// that only exists in the types ("at type-level").
class Temperature<T> extends TypeWrapper<number> {}
class Fahrenheit { }
class Celsius { }

function createF(n: number): Temperature<Fahrenheit> {
  return Temperature.wrap(n);
}

function convertFtoC(
  f: Temperature<Fahrenheit>
): Temperature<Celsius> {
  const n = Temperature.unwrap(f);
  return Temperature.wrap((n - 32) / 1.8);
}

const boiling = convertFtoC(createF(212));
console.log(Temperature.unwrap(boiling)); // => 100
```

<small id="note-1">1. I've intentionally avoided calling this Flow technique "newtyping", mostly because Haskell's `newtype` lets you do things that we can't with this, eg. `newtype Foo a = Foo (a -> String)`, where it's not a straight "value wrapping".</small>
