Or, as it was known at the time, the "Ruby is Doomed" talk:

As the second slide quotes, I [regret calling it that](https://twitter.com/damncabbage/status/533865761723281408).

With the rise of the newest round of statically-typed languages (Swift, Go, Rust)
[epicycle of sorts](http://users.clas.ufl.edu/ufhatch/images/earthCenterRetrograde.gif) (you could call Java part of the last loop)
I fear that, barring a leap forward like [PHP did with Facebook's Hack/HHVM](http://hacklang.org), Ruby will be very much left behind. Performance problems completely aside, having to cherry-pick and manually write test cases to run your code over and over again in attempt to determine basic properties about it feels to me, as I explain in the talk, like boxing with a hand behind your back against an Apollo Creed sporting many, many arms.
