_This is a post for people who speak at meetups, people who host meetups, and anyone who wants to get the word out about a speaker they enjoy listening to._

Many, many meetup talks are slaved over for weeks, given to an appreciative audience, and then vanish into the ether. Meetup organisation is super-stressful already, and adding video recording and editing on top is likely untenable for anyone who's already over-stretched.

So that sucks. But there's a method I use to record my own talks in a pinch:

* Put my phone (an old iPhone 4) on the lectern sill or some other flat surface nearby, and use the in-built _Voice Memos_ app to record audio.
* Export my slides as PDF, uploaded to this site.

And, if I have time:

* Use something like [Screenflick](http://www.araelium.com/screenflick) (or even _QuickTime Player_ with its _New Screen Recording_ option) to get a screen-capture video recording of the slides being stepped through, synchronised to the audio recording. I have the PDF open, recording the screen while I listen to the audio and stab the right-arrow key a bunch of times.

"But that sounds like the same amount of effort!" â€“ The difference here is that the capturing part is far easier; the up-front effort is minimal, but now you have at least *some* raw material to work with, even if you end up just dumping the slides + raw audio online somewhere (like [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com) and [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com)). If someone is excited enough about the talk, they might [volunteer to do this audio/slide-matching stage for you](https://twitter.com/damncabbage/status/728797145248096257).

I try to get and audio capture of my own talks, except if there's someone doing the recording I trust, or if I forget because I'm completely frazzled before a talk. Even [conferences can stuff up the audio](https://vimeo.com/131377935), so it's a nice thing to get into a habit of doing for your own sake as a backup.

Some previous done-with-Screenflick examples of mine, for reference:

* [Property-Based Testing, Railscamp 2015](http://robhoward.id.au/talks/2015/06/property-based-testing/)
* [Composition and Pipelines, Rorosyd 2015](http://robhoward.id.au/talks/2015/09/composition-and-pipelines/)  
  (I'm less happy with this because I tried to merge two audio streams and I got a bit of an echo out of it towards the end; I unfortunately lost the originals to a disk failure.)

If anyone else is trying this, and have suggestions and tips, I'd love to [hear from you](https://twitter.com/damncabbage). ðŸ˜€
