  <p>This is a short series of posts about type-checking in JavaScript, mostly with <a href="http://flowtype.org">Flow</a> and <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript</a>. Its focus is less the basics of their use, and more how to wield them effectively.</p>
  <p>The title is (with some measure of hubris) named after <a href="https://vimeo.com/14313378">Yaron Minsky's 2009 <em>"Effective ML"</em> talk</a> (in turn which is named after an <em>"Effective Java"</em> talk); I recommend you check it out, particularly for its <em>"make illegal states unrepresentable"</em> section on type design.</p>
